CS3012 Software Engineering Assignment

Accordingly, you will be graded based on your adherence to the following procedure:

- Choose a unit testing framework. A comprehensive by language list is available here.
- Create a repository on a git service such as Github. Your work will be implemented in this repository.
- Define a set of initial unit tests that capture the basic expected behaviour. 
  This will require you to create sample data and also to identify the basic API for your solution.
- Build your initial solution, testing it against your test code until it is working.
- Refine the solution, expanding your test cases to deal with awkward parameters and edge cases that push the 
  limits of your solution, enhancing your solution to deal with these.
  
I've chosen to tackle this assignment using Haskell and the HUnit testing framework.
